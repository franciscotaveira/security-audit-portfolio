# 🚀 Security Brain - Launch Manual (Owner Only)

This document contains all critical information about your SaaS. Keep it safe.

## 1. The Product
- **Name:** Security Brain (The Self-Healing IDE)
- **Current URL:** https://security-brain.vercel.app
- **Value Proposition:** The first IDE that uses 6 Specialized AI Agents (NSA Security, HFT Performance, Clean Code) to autonomously fix code.

## 2. Technology (The "Invisible Arsenal")
The power of the tool lies in the **"Chain of Thought" System Prompts** hidden in the code (`src/App.tsx`).
- **Security Officer:** Mentally simulates attacks before fixing.
- **Performance Guru:** Searches for O(n²) complexity and memory allocations.
- **Architect:** Analyzes enterprise design patterns.

*The user sees only the button; AI does the heavy lifting behind the scenes.*

## 3. Authentication & Security (Shielding)
- **Provider:** Clerk (clerk.com)
- **Public Key:** `pk_test_cHJvdmVuLWluc2VjdC03MC5jbGVyay5hY2NvdW50cy5kZXYk`
- **Security:**
  - Login via OAuth (Google/Email) - No passwords to leak.
  - Route Protection: The IDE only loads if the Clerk token is valid.
  - Serverless Infrastructure (Vercel): Immune to traditional server attacks (there is no server to hack).

## 4. Payments (Monetization)
- **Provider:** Stripe
- **Model:** Monthly Subscription ($29/month) or Free Access with Limits.
- **Bypass:** PRO users bring their own key (BYOK), making your profit margin almost 100%.

## 5. How to Configure Custom Domain (.com / .io)
1. Buy your domain (ex: `securitybrain.io`) on Namecheap or Godaddy.
2. Access: [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
3. Go to: **Settings** > **Domains**.
4. Add your domain.
5. Copy the DNS values (A Record / CNAME) and paste them into the panel where you bought the domain.
6. Wait ~1h for the SSL certificate (HTTPS) to be automatically generated.

## 6. Next Steps (Scale)
- [ ] **Configure Email Marketing:** Integrate Clerk with Resend/Mailchimp to send security tips.
- [ ] **Analytics:** Add PostHog or Google Analytics to see where users get stuck.
- [ ] **Mobile:** Adjust Monaco Editor CSS to work better on tablets/phones (currently Desktop focused).
